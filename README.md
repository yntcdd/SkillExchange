## Inspiration
We wanted to create a platform that makes finding a pet easier and more meaningful. By helping people connect with animals suited to their needs, we hope to support lifelong, fulfilling pet relationships.

## What it does
Our site showcases profiles of various pets, detailing their personalities and preferences. Additionally, a tailored quiz helps users find a pet that aligns well with their lifestyle and expectations, ensuring a strong match.

## How we built it
Our website was developed using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. We focused on creating an intuitive interface, balancing both aesthetic appeal and functionality for a smooth user experience.

## Challenges we ran into
Ensuring full responsiveness on multiple devices was a major challenge, along with curating a diverse list of pets. Each pet profile had to accurately reflect the unique traits of the animals.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Weâ€™re proud to offer a platform where users can discover and connect with pets perfectly suited for them. Our user-friendly and interactive website truly enhances the pet adoption experience.

## What we learned
During development, we gained insights into both web design best practices and the unique traits of different animals, all while creating a polished, responsive website for users of all ages.

## What's next for Pet Adoption Matchmaking Portal
We aim to increase the variety of pets available and improve our quiz, making it even easier for users to find pets that complement their personalities and lifestyles perfectly.
