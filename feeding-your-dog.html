                    <h3>Age and Size of Your Dog</h3>
                    <p>Different breeds and ages of dogs have specific nutritional needs. Puppies require more protein and fats, while senior dogs may need lower-calorie options to maintain a healthy weight.</p>

                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>Breed-Specific Diets</h3>
                    <p>Some breeds have specific dietary requirements due to health conditions. For instance, large breeds may benefit from food that helps joint health, while small breeds often need more calories in smaller portions.</p>
